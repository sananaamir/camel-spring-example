# Camel Spring Example

This project is intended for engineers who are trying to get a head start in camel integration with Spring. Below is a list of the functionality:

- Route input from temp/input
- File Processor converts string to List of Integers
- Sum Processor adds the Integers
- Route output to temp/sumOutput

*NOTE:* with every new run of app, make sure the input files are moved from `/temp/input/.camel` to `/temp/input`
